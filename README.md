# Pokemon Battler
Creating a pokemon battle app using React.js and GraphQl queries to external API

I was inspired to make a pokemon battle app from this React tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKFoAF7J0mc

The app chooses two pokemon that enter into a battle. Pokemon HP left, turn, and messages are kept as state variables 
This is an an excercise in learning React Hooks and functional components instead of class components

The pokemon container and cards are taken from the tutorial. Repo can be found at https://github.com/karlhadwen/pokemon

The battle container chooses 2 pokemon from the graphQL query and sets them up into a battle.
Click do move to choose one of the moves at random until a pokemon is defeated.

## Future Plans:
* Allow user to choose two pokemons themselves to face off
* Allow user to choose which move is used
* Pretty up the Battle UI once above functionality is set
